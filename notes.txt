for the tiny and small arrays the inset is faster, for all the bigger arrays the append does so much better 
it takes about 555 milliseconds for the insert when taking in the extraLargeArray and only 4 milliseconds for the append
but the insert takes about 20 microseconds when taking in the tinyArray and the append about 56 microseconds
